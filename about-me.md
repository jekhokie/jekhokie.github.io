Ever since I gained an interest in becoming an engineer, I have amassed hundreds (if not thousands) of
emails, Evernote notes, text documents, HTML pages, random documents named "x" or "y", etc. artifacts
containing information about technology and products I've invested time in exploring, learning and (in
some cases) mastering. As a way to clean up this information and make it both more useful to myself and
possibly help others learn from my mistakes and successes, I am now taking the time to publish something
more formal and public, thus forcing me to refine the presentation of the data to make it more consumable.

This site is my way of sharing my knowledge and professional profile. It is intended to grow into a
complete knowledge base and demonstration of my technical (and possibly other) interests and abilities
as I continue to expand my knowledge of recent technologies and fundamental concepts.

If you'd like to know more about me and my professional career, you can find details

To learn more about my leadership style and approach, these are good articles that detail how I approach
problems and my overall approach to be one of the most versatile Engineering leaders in my career field:

Over Thanksgiving in 2015, we took a trip to Germany and toured many cities around the
country. The trip was mostly centered around Christmas Markets (Christkindlmarkt), but
included some exquisite side-tours of castles and scenery. Although typically the rainy
season in the country, we were able to see some scenes with snow. There were many cities
and places visited that are not included in this list, but these are the highlights with
pictures.

**Trip Dates**: *November 25, 2015 - December 5, 2015*

**Note**: The images below are in a 'carousel' format, so you can click on the left/right of the
image to scroll through the collection of images for the location, and click in the center of an
image to view a slightly enlarged version of the image.

### Freiburg ***<small>([Link](http://www.germany.travel/en/towns-cities-culture/towns-cities/historic-highlights-of-germany/freiburg.html))</small>***

Our first visit in Germany, this town was nestled in the western side of the country. The cobblestone
streets matched with the amazing countryside that varied between rolling green hills and snowy
mountains made for amazing pictures.

                      [![Freiburg 3][3]][3],
                      [![Freiburg 4][4]][4]" | split: "," %}
{% include image-carousel.html id="freiburg" %}

### Schloss Lichtenstein ***<small>([Link](http://www.schloss-lichtenstein.de/en/))</small>***

The Lichtenstein Castle, set at the top of a cliff overlooking the city it once managed, was
covered in snow. We were fortunate enough to have been one of only two couples visiting, and
as the other couple also spoke English, the tour guide was kind enough to give the tour in
English. Re-built as a hunting house, this castle had a huge drawbridge and several other
out buildings worth exploring.

{% assign carousel = "[![Lichtenstein 1][5]][5],
                      [![Lichtenstein 2][6]][6],
                      [![Lichtenstein 3][7]][7],
                      [![Lichtenstein 4][8]][8],
                      [![Lichtenstein 5][9]][9]" | split: "," %}
{% include image-carousel.html id="lichtenstein" %}

### Solitude Palace ***<small>([Link](http://www.schloss-solitude.de/en/home/))</small>***

A deviation from our schedule, we stopped to see the Solitude Palace. This castle was mostly
closed/boarded for the winter months, but still worth visiting for the scale of the buildings
and the views of the city it overlooked.

{% assign carousel = "[![Solitude 1][10]][10],
                      [![Solitude 2][11]][11],
                      [![Solitude 3][12]][12]" | split: "," %}
{% include image-carousel.html id="solitude" %}

### Residenz Wuerzburg ***<small>([Link](http://www.residenz-wuerzburg.de/englisch/residenz/))</small>***

Another deviation from the schedule, Wurzburg turned out to be a wonderful architectural city
that we wished we had more time to explore. We stopped to visit the Residenz Wuerzburg, which
with its vast gardens, appeared mystical. The original building can be seen off in the distance
in one of the photos - the close-up building is the rebuild of an old estate.

{% assign carousel = "[![Wuerzburg 1][13]][13],

                      [![Wuerzburg 4][16]][16]" | split: "," %}
{% include image-carousel.html id="wuerzburg" %}

### Nuremberg ***<small>([Link](https://www.nuernberg.de/internet/stadtportal_e/))</small>***

One of our favorites and highly desired, the city of Nuremberg is surrounded by old castle walls
and features architecture that appears original to the time period. Visiting the castle while
there gave a decent view of the city, although it was slightly overcast. Along with the fantastic
vendors at the Christmas Market, the catholic churches were overly-stimulating to look at given
the amount of marble, gold, and carvings.

{% assign carousel = "[![Nuremberg 1][17]][17],

                      [![Nuremberg 8][24]][24]" | split: "," %}
{% include image-carousel.html id="nuremberg" %}

### Seiffen ***<small>([Link](https://seiffen.de/))</small>***

This small village near the eastern edge of Germany (near Czech Republic) is knows as the Christmas
capital of the world. Filled with thousands of different kinds of wood carvings, it's a place anyone
who loves Christmas would be excited to visit. The [Richard Glasser manufacturing shop](http://www.glaesser-seiffen.de/)
is also a great place to visit and tour as you can see the various stages involved with making
ornaments and wooden pyramids as the workers do their jobs right in front of you. In the U.S. you often
see candles in the windows of homes around Christmas time - in Germany, they fill their windows with
Schwibbogen (German candle arches). Make sure you also visit the famous Seiffen church and see the
kissing figurines and over-sided pyramid. Go back in the evening to see the many lights and decorations,
including street-lined lanterns.

                      [![Seiffen 5][29]][29]" | split: "," %}
{% include image-carousel.html id="seiffen" %}

### Prague ***<small>([Link](http://www.prague.eu/en))</small>***

An architectural masterpiece, this World War 2 holdover is an amazing city to visit. The buildings
hold true to the era in which they were built, and the cobblestone streets are as clean as can be
given the overnight workers that routinely clean up after the many tourists that visit. The [Old Town
Square](https://www.pragueexperience.com/places.asp?PlaceID=594) fills with visitors and booths
during the Christmas markets. We were fortunate enough to stay right in the square in a room
overlooking all the activities and the
[Prague Astrological Clock](http://www.czechtourism.com/c/prague-astronomical-clock/).

{% assign carousel = "[![Prague 1][30]][30],
                      [![Prague 2][31]][31],
                      [![Prague 3][32]][32],

### Prague Castle ***<small>([Link](https://www.hrad.cz/en/prague-castle-for-visitors))</small>***

This one was in Prague, but warranted a post by itself (with a separate bunch of pictures). Set up
high overlooking the city, this expansive castle has a great walking tour. There are several main
spots to see inside the castle, including a church that puts many others to shame in terms of its
decor.

{% assign carousel = "[![Prague Castle 1][40]][40],
                      [![Prague Castle 2][41]][41],
                      [![Prague Castle 3][42]][42],

                      [![Prague Castle 12][51]][51]" | split: "," %}
{% include image-carousel.html id="prague-castle" %}

### Munich ***<small>([Link](http://www.muenchen.de/int/en.html))</small>***

One of the larger and more modern cities, Munich is definitely more for the city-dwellers. With
its high-end shops and [Glockenspiel](http://www.destination-munich.com/munich-glockenspiel.html)
(which happened to be under construction while we were there), the
[Marienplatz](http://gogermany.about.com/od/sightsandattractions/ss/Marienplatz-Munich.htm) center
fills with Christmas market vendors. Munich also happens to be where we picked up our very own
cuckoo clock in the [Max Krug](http://www.max-krug.com/) store (surprisingly it shipped to us in
one piece). Today, our son loves listening to the cuckoo birds chirp and the song and dancers that
move on the hour.

{% assign carousel = "[![Munich 1][52]][52],
                      [![Munich 2][53]][53],
                      [![Munich 3][54]][54],
                      [![Munich 4][55]][55],

### Remembering the Events

Some quick memories from the trip:

* Food run in Nuremberg on Sunday evening at 2AM (nothing open, nothing around).
* Autobahn (of course).
* Driving in Czech Republic (never again).
* Cold-war Czech Republic.
* Asking people in Cartier to call our hotel because we couldn't reach it through the market -
response of "We don't do that, we're a store, get out".
* 5-star corner hotel room overlooking the Prague center Christmas market.
* Driving down roadways that didn't feel like they were public roads (more like walking paths).
* Following a police car into a no driving zone (and being nicely corrected shortly thereafter).
* Guards/marching at the Prague Castle.
* Constantly defending against being ripped off in Prague (taxi driver, etc.).
* Potato pancakes.
* Bratwurst (and more bratwurst).

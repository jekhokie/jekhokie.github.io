                    Conway's Game of Life project using the Phaser.js HTML5 web framework and adds random cell initialization.

                    A traditional representation of Conway's Game of Life using the Phaser.js HTML5 web framework. This is a very
                    basic representation of animation and array patterns to further explore the Phaser.js framework.

                    A kids game built using the Phaser.js HTML5 web framework to teach children how to identify various
                    shapes and colors. Game includes very basic functionality and is lacking some DRY concepts, but serves
                    its purpose (entertaining the little one).

                    A web-based mortgage calculator intended to grow in functionality and performs monthly payments, total
                    interest paid, an amortization schedule, etc. There are plenty of mortage calculators out there already,
                    but this tool was intended to grow into a much larger project to allow predicting calculations such as
                "what if I made a one-time extra principal payment".

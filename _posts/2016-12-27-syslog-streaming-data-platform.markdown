Comprehensive tutorial detailing how to install, configure, and test a processing pipeline that receives
log messages from any number of syslog-ng clients, processes the incoming log messages real-time, and
stores the raw filtered results into a local log directory as well as sends alerts based on thresholds
being exceeded. This tutorial will also include basic abnormality detection as a demonstration of the
Spark abilities.

### Background

Analyzing logs and events in the modern-day is typically handled via contracts with SaaS providers that
have somewhat mature and robust analytics platforms for mining information out of the forwarded events
and logs. However, using SaaS providers can prove to be a headache depending on their implementation.
Some providers require a central relay that all clients must forward to, and almost all require a specific
agent to be installed on the client to handle the forwarding of data. These agents, while necessary, can
be quite burdensome given their resource footprint.

This tutorial explains an alternative solution to both utilizing SaaS providers as well as heavyweight
agents. It focuses on the second part of the streaming data pipeline and attempts to solve the issue of
heavyweight agents being required for forwarding and analyzing logging data via using the lightweight
syslog-ng process, which is available for almost any operating system. Specifically, this article is
intended to be a comprehensive culmination of the following previously written posts/tutorials:

- [Installing Kafka]({% post_url 2016-08-23-installing-kafka %})
- [Journey to Near-Real-Time Processing]({% post_url 2016-11-07-journey-to-near-real-time-processing %})
- [syslog-ng Tutorial]({% post_url 2016-12-20-syslog-ng-tutorial %})
- [Integrate syslog-ng with Kafka]({% post_url 2016-12-21-integrate-syslog-ng-with-kafka %})

#### WARNING

This tutorial is by **NO MEANS** meant to convey a functional architecture that is ready for production
use. It is, instead, a tutorial based on completing the requirements necessary to realize a fully
functional processing pipeline. Using the details verbatim as your production processing pipeline **WILL**
result in unexpected behavior and catastrophic failure at scale. Considerations must be made with respect
to bandwidth, processing power, storage, etc. for a fully-functioning, robust, and performant production
system.

### Use Case

We are going to take a practical example to design towards in this tutorial. Although the example is
likely very mundane and possibly not applicable in most environments given the cloud-based and other
infrastructure-related DDoS and fraud detection systems, it will be a good demonstration of the
capabilities that are possible with this type of data streaming stack.

Consider a scenario where there are multiple web application or REST endpoints exposed to the public
internet, consumed by various other services and users. The endpoints support REST-based methods such
as GET, POST, PUT, etc. Also consider that you already have a system in place that tracks/trends metrics
related to the number of requests per second, including the type of request.

With the above, you have a decent understanding of the "steady state" of your system. That is to say,
you likely know the typical or average number of GET requests per second, POST requests per second, etc.
If, however, you were to notice an up-tick of POST requests on the order of a 20% increase over, say,
10 seconds, it is possible that you have had a surge in traffic, but if your typical requests are in
the millions, a 20% increase is a huge number that is less likely to be "normal". In these cases, you
will likely want to very quickly identify such a scenario and alert someone to start looking into it
(or in a more mature environment, have your software and services use such alerting information to
automatically adjust and handle such cases).

The processing stack proposed below is a basic building block for the above scenario. Given a typical
REST service endpoint, we can track web requests (specifically, POST requests) and alert based on
whether the number of requests in a defined period exceeds a percentage increase threshold. Such an
ability is critically helpful to quick resolution and defense against fraud and DDoS attacks.

### Software and Service Components

The respective versions of software used in this tutorial are as follows. Other versions **may** work
using these instructions but, as usual, your mileage may vary:

- **syslog-ng**: 3.7.3
- **Apache ZooKeeper**: 3.4.6-1569965
- **Apache Kafka**: 2.11-0.10.0.1
- **Scala**: 2.11
- **Spark**: 2.0.1

### Underlying Compute Technology/Ecosystem

The following assumptions are made about your infrastructure. Although the instructions can be extended
to accommodate cloud-based and/or other infrastructure environments quite easily, all details are
explained with respect to local development for the purposes of simplicity:

- **Hypervisor Technology**: VirtualBox
- **Provisioner**: Vagrant
- **Number of VMs**: 4
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 16.04
- **Arch**: 64-bit
- **CPUs**: 2
- **Mem**: 2GB
- **Disk**: 20GB

This tutorial is built with 4 virtual machines. The following hostnames and corresponding IP addresses
will be used for the 4 virtual machine instances:

- **node1.localhost**: 10.11.13.15
- **node2.localhost**: 10.11.13.16
- **node3.localhost**: 10.11.13.17
- **node4.localhost**: 10.11.13.18

Finally, the code blocks included in this tutorial will list, as a comment, the node(s) that the commands
following need to be run on. For instance, if required on all nodes, the code will include a comment like
so:

{% highlight bash %}
# Node: node1.localhost, node2.localhost, node3.localhost, node4.localhost
{% endhighlight %}

If the code block only applies to one of the nodes, it will list the specific node it applies to
like so:

{% highlight bash %}
# Node: node2.localhost
{% endhighlight %}

All commands assume that your user is `vagrant` and the user's corresponding home directory is
`/home/vagrant` for the purposes of running sudo commands.

### End State Architecture

At the end of this tutorial, the following end-state architecture will be realized (where "Server"
is the remote instance of syslog-ng where the Client will forward logs to). Obviously in an ideal
scenario the cluster-based technologies will contain a ecosystem of resources of their own, but for
simplicity and resource sake, we will install it on the respective nodes as though they were their
own standalone instance:

[![Architecture][1]][1]

To summarize the data flow in steps/words:

1. syslog-ng client on node1 sends logs to syslog-ng server (remote) on node2.
2. syslog-ng server on node2 accepts logs, and forwards them to Kafka on node1.
3. Kafka on node1 accepts logs, and stores them in the "events" topic locally.
4. Spark job (running on node4) allocated by scheduler (running on node3) parses logs from Kafka:
    - Raw POST data sent to local disk under a directory structure that includes a date and time stamp.
    - Alerts (threshold exceeded events) sent via HTTP POST to the Dashboard on node3.
5. Alerting dashboard on node3 updates its respective alerting mechanism to reflect an excess of
POST requests over specified time interval.

Not depicted is an actual REST application - this application will run on node1 and development of the
client is left as an exercise to the reader in whichever framework or technology they are comfortable in.
Options such as basic Apache or Nginx servers are a possibility for quick implementation. This tutorial,
however, will assume an Apache instance and utilize the access logs (out of box defaults) for parsing
the respective method calls.

Additionally, the "Spark Worker" depicted on "node4.localhost" is slightly notional - this tutorial
focuses on running the Spark job locally on the scheduler itself in order to view the print output
for debugging purposes. It will be called out following the local run of the job what changes need to
occur in order to submit the job in "cluster" mode, at which time the job could be instantiated and
run from the worker node itself on "node4.localhost".

As a note - it is likely not a great idea to simply send "alerts" in a boolean sense directly to the
dashboard endpoint. This is tight coupling and limits the usefulness of the data. Instead, alternative
options such as time-series databases, key/value stores, etc. should be considered. We will continue
with sending data directly to the dashboard in this tutorial to demonstrate Spark's ability to output
values to external systems as well as for simplicity in design. Which architecture you choose in a more
production environment is entirely dependent on both your use case and desire to have separation of
concerns to help with technology abstraction (if necessary).

### Technology Stack

It is **REQUIRED** that you follow the instructions contained in these tutorials prior to proceeding,
in the order specified. Note that you must replace corresponding IP addresses and hostnames where
necessary to match the detailed architecture at the start of this post:

1. [Install Apache ZooKeeper]({% post_url 2016-11-07-journey-to-near-real-time-processing %}#apache-zookeeper)
    - Install the ZooKeeper service on "node1.localhost" (10.11.13.15) as the architecture diagram
above details.
2. [Install Apache Kafka]({% post_url 2016-11-07-journey-to-near-real-time-processing %}#apache-kafka)
    - Install the Kafka service on "node1.localhost" (10.11.13.15) as the architecture diagram
above details.
    - Ensure that when you create the first test topic you name it "events" if you wish to be
consistent with both the architecture diagram above and the Spark application that will be
developed in this tutorial.
3. [Integrate syslog-ng with Kafka]({% post_url 2016-12-21-integrate-syslog-ng-with-kafka %})
    - Install the syslog-ng client on "node1.localhost" (10.11.13.15) and the syslog-ng server on
"node2.localhost" (10.11.13.16) as the architecture diagram above details.
    - Ignore the "Kafka" section in this linked article as you can simply re-use what you performed
in step 2 above to install Apache Kafka on "node1.localhost".
    - You will likely need to update the "client" (node1.localhost) syslog-ng configuration to point
to a local Apache or other access log file for the Spark application to function as expected.

The steps following this section assume that you have followed these previous tutorials and have
a fully-functioning syslog-ng ecosystem forwarding logs to the Kafka instance. Failure to first
perform this listed tutorial will result in a non-functioning technology stack.

#### Install and Configure Spark

This next part to install and configure Spark is a repeat of a previous post
[here]({% post_url 2016-11-07-journey-to-near-real-time-processing %}#apache-spark). The steps
will be repeated below for consistency and to ensure accuracy with the environment in which the
technology is now installed, and the Master and Worker nodes are slightly different.

As a prerequisite, you need to install the Java dependencies if not already installed:

{% highlight bash %}
# Node: node3.localhost, node4.localhost
$ sudo apt-get install default-jre default-jdk
{% endhighlight %}

Ensure that all 4 hostnames are resolvable between the various hosts - this can be as simple as
adding a line to the `/etc/hosts` file on each node to ensure hostname resolution is possible.

Next, download and extract the required package:

{% highlight bash %}
# Node: node3.localhost, node4.localhost
$ cd ~
$ wget http://d3kbcqa49mib13.cloudfront.net/spark-2.0.1-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz
$ tar xzf spark-2.0.1-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz
$ cd spark-2.0.1-bin-hadoop2.7/
{% endhighlight %}

Create a logging directory for the Spark process:

{% highlight bash %}
# Node: node3.localhost, node4.localhost
$ sudo mkdir /var/log/spark
{% endhighlight %}

Set some configurations for the Spark processes - note that some memory tuning is done in order
to ensure that jobs do not over-commit the small amount of VM resources, but the memory specified
in these configurations are way too low for any kind of complicated processing:

{% highlight bash %}
# Node: node3.localhost, node4.localhost
$ cp conf/spark-defaults.conf.template conf/spark-defaults.conf
$ vim conf/spark-defaults.conf
# add the following configuration directives to the end of the file:
#   spark.driver.memory=512m
#   spark.executor.memory=512m
#   spark.executor.cores=1

# Node: node3.localhost, node4.localhost
$ cp conf/spark-env.sh.template conf/spark-env.sh
$ chmod 775 conf/spark-env.sh

# Node: node3.localhost
$ vim conf/spark-env.sh
# add the following configuration directives to the end of the file:
#   SPARK_MASTER_HOST=10.11.13.17
#   SPARK_LOG_DIR=/var/log/spark

# Node: node4.localhost
$ vim conf/spark-env.sh
# add the following configuration directives to the end of the file:
#   SPARK_LOCAL_IP=10.11.13.18
#   SPARK_LOG_DIR=/var/log/spark
{% endhighlight %}

Once the above configuration files are in place, you can start the Spark processes. Ensure that the
processes are started in this order to ensure that the worker can connect to the master instance:

{% highlight bash %}
# Node: node2.localhost
$ sudo /home/vagrant/spark-2.0.1-bin-hadoop2.7/sbin/start-master.sh
# you should see some output along the lines of:
#   starting org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master, logging to /var/log/spark/spark-root-org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master-1-node3.out

# Node: node3.localhost
$ sudo /home/vagrant/spark-2.0.1-bin-hadoop2.7/sbin/start-slave.sh spark://10.11.13.16:7077
# you should see some output along the lines of:
#   starting org.apache.spark.deploy.worker.Worker, logging to /var/log/spark/spark-root-org.apache.spark.deploy.worker.Worker-1-node4.out
{% endhighlight %}

Once you have performed the above, you can follow the steps under the "Apache Spark -> Validation"
section in the original post [here]({% post_url 2016-11-07-journey-to-near-real-time-processing %})
if you wish to validate your installation. Remember to replace all hostnames and IP addresses in the
validation section with the respective hostnames/IP addresses of the hosts in this specific tutorial.

### Spark Streaming - Abnormality Detection

Now that we have a fully-functioning ecosystem, we can develop the Spark Streaming application.
We will expand on the steps detailed
[here]({% post_url 2016-11-07-journey-to-near-real-time-processing %}#apache-spark-streaming)
to develop and schedule a Spark application that parses events for POST requests made of a REST
endpoint to determine if the number of POST requests has increased more than 20 percent for the
last 10 seconds as compared to the previous 10 second batch. The example is being kept simple in
terms of hard-coded values but in reality, this would likely be a somewhat useless functionality
without trending-based adjustments to the threshold limits (which are a bit more advanced than
needed for this tutorial).

#### Application Development

To get started, first create the directory structure required for the application on
"node3.localhost":

{% highlight bash %}
# Node: node3.localhost
$ cd ~
$ mkdir TestApp
$ cd TestApp/
$ mkdir -p lib \
           project \
           src/main/scala
{% endhighlight %}

Next, construct the `assembly.sbt` file to specify we wish to create an "uber jar" (packaged with
most of the required dependencies to avoid having to specify classpath and/or send libs to
the executor when the application is started):

{% highlight bash %}
# Node: node3.localhost
$ vim project/assembly.sbt
# ensure contains the following:
#   addSbtPlugin("com.eed3si9n" % "sbt-assembly" % "0.14.2")
{% endhighlight %}

Once you have configured the environment for the assembly plugin, construct the Scala build tool
project metadata file as follows. Place the following code contents into the file
`/home/vagrant/TestApp/build.sbt` on "node3.localhost":

{% highlight scala %}
name := "TestApp"
version := "0.0.1"
scalaVersion := "2.11.6"

libraryDependencies += "org.apache.spark" % "spark-core_2.11" % "2.0.1" % "provided"
libraryDependencies += "org.apache.spark" % "spark-streaming_2.11" % "2.0.1" % "provided"
libraryDependencies += "org.apache.spark" % "spark-streaming-kafka-0-10_2.11" % "2.0.1"
libraryDependencies += "org.scalaj" % "scalaj-http_2.11" % "2.3.0"

// override any 'deduplicate' strategy with a 'pick last to avoid errors'
assemblyMergeStrategy in assembly := {
  case PathList("META-INF", "MANIFEST.MF") => MergeStrategy.discard
  case x => MergeStrategy.last
}
{% endhighlight %}

Next, construct the application code. Details about code functionality are included as comments
within the code blocks themselves. Note again that this code is VERY fragile in the sense that
boundary-condition checking is minimal and efficiency is non-optimal - it is intended to be
a VERY basic starting point for this tutorial alone. Place the following code contents inside
the file `/home/vagrant/TestApp/src/main/scala/TestApp.scala` on "node3.localhost"

{% highlight scala %}

            System.exit(1)
        }
        val Array(brokerInstances, topicName, alertURL) = args

        // create a configuration and new Spark, SQL, and Streaming context
        val sparkConf = new SparkConf().setAppName("Abnormality Detection")
        val ssc = new StreamingContext(sparkConf, BATCH_INT)

        // set up the configuration for the stream processing from Kafka data
        val kafkaParams = Map[String, Object](
            "bootstrap.servers"  -> brokerInstances,
            "key.deserializer"   -> classOf[StringDeserializer],

            "enable.auto.commit" -> (false: java.lang.Boolean)
        )

        // create the Direct Stream integration for processing
        val stream = KafkaUtils.createDirectStream[String, String](
            ssc,
            PreferConsistent,

        )

        // calculate (rough) whether there is an abnormal increase in total

        // Note: There will only ever be a single RDD based on usage of a

        // this way is "safe enough"
        // also note that although filtering of POST messages are included,
        // if any run includes data that has NO POST messages, this code will fail

            var change = 0.00

            if (rdd.count() > 0) {

                // in this method is likely unsafe and it would be better to transform the

                // but for simplicity this will work, and opening/creating Kafka connections
                // without using partitions in this case will also suffice (although
                // definitely not best practice)
                println("Capturing POST operations...\n")
                val postOps = rdd.filter(event => POST_PATTERN.findFirstIn(event.value).isDefined)
                postOpCount = postOps.count()
                println(postOpCount + " POST operations captured.\n")

                // write the raw POST records to a file
                println("Writing raw POST data to file...\n")
                postOps.saveAsTextFile(filePath)
                println("Raw data written to: " + filePath + "\n")

                // compare current batch to previous batch for rate of change
                println("Calculating % change from previous batch...\n")
                change = ((postOpCount.toFloat - previousCount.get().toFloat) / postOpCount.toFloat) * 100
            } else {
                // determine if we've gone from something to nothing, or stayed stable
                // at 0 records between batches (0% change)
                println("No records in RDD\n")
                if (previousCount.get() > 0) {
                    change = -100.00
                }
            }

            // keep track of current for next batch interval, and output change result
            println("% change calculated: " + change + " | (PREV: " + previousCount.get() + " | CUR: " + postOpCount + ")\n")
            previousCount.set(postOpCount)

            // check if change rate exceeded threshold and, if so, alert/send data to Dashboard
            if (scala.math.abs(change) > THRESHOLD) {

                // publish the change rate result to the dashboard
                // NOTE: This is NOT exception-safe - if the dashboard is down, bad

Once you have created the directory structure and respective application files/code, run the `sbt`
command to assemble your "uber" jar:

{% highlight bash %}
# Node: node3.localhost

#   [success] Total time: 16 s, completed Dec 27, 2016 11:15:33 PM
{% endhighlight %}

If the `[success]` line shows up at the bottom of the output generated, your uber jar has been
successfully assembled and is ready for use.

#### Dashboard - Install and Create View

Let's get the Dashing dashboard installed and configured - we will be using the
[Dashing](http://dashing.io/) dashboard framework. This tool is outdated and no longer in active
development, but is robust enough to get a very simple dashboard up and running very quickly. To
help with staying more current, we will install the forked/maintained version of the dashboard
[Smashing](https://github.com/Smashing/smashing).

The steps that follow are all implemented on "node3.localhost". Therefore, the notes about which
node to run the commands on are omitted for brevity.

##### Installation

To install Smashing, the system requires Ruby and bundler to be installed. Recommended is to use
the [RVM](https://rvm.io/) version management system - instructions can be found via the link
provided.

Once Ruby and bundler are installed, we can get started installing the Smashing framework by following
the instructions in the README [here](https://github.com/Smashing/smashing). One note - there is a
well documented issue [here](https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/issues/119) regarding using the Thin
framework for serving the dashboard (dashboard will not update/will apear to hang when using Thin on
certain operating systems and browser combinations). These instructions include installing and using
Puma to serve the dashboard in order to address this issue:

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd ~
$ gem install smashing
$ smashing new stream_alert
$ cd stream_alert/
$ vim Gemfile
# to accommodate AJAX functionality, we need a JavaScript
# execution engine - we will use the most common:
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
# also need to install puma to avoid "not updating" issue
$ vim Gemfile
# add the following line:
#   gem 'puma'
$ bundle install
$ puma config.ru
{% endhighlight %}

Once the above has been completed, you should have a fully functioning Smashing dashboard. Open a
browser window and navigate to http://10.11.13.17:9292 - if all is successful, you should see a
Smashing example dashboard with example widgets that are updated approximately every 2 seconds.

##### Custom Dashboard Creation

Now that our Smashing framework is up and running, we can get started with creating our own custom
dashboard. Place the following HTML contents into the file `/home/vagrant/stream_alert/dashboards/stream.erb`
on "node3.localhost":

{% highlight ERB %}
<% content_for :title do %>Stream Alerting<% end %>
<div class="gridster">
    <ul>
        <li data-row="1" data-col="1" data-sizex="4" data-sizey="1">
            <div data-id="alerts" data-view="List" data-unordered="true" data-title="Alerts" data-moreinfo="Alerts from the streaming platform"></div>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

Since we will be using the POST method of communication from Spark to the dashboard directly (again,
this is certainly not preferred, but simple for this tutorial), there are no jobs to configure in
the Smashing framework. Let's go ahead and start our Smashing dashboard server - if it is still
running from the setup instructions above, kill it and restart it:

{% highlight bash %}
$ puma config.ru
{% endhighlight %}

Next, visit our new dashboard by navigating to `http://10.11.13.17:9292/stream`. There should be a
single widget with the title "Alerts" on the page with no data.

#### End to End Test

Now, let's launch the created application. Doing so in this fashion ensures that you will see the
`println` output statements but is definitely not the way you would want to deploy your application
in a production-like environment (for prod-like environments, use of "cluster" deployment mode is
much preferred). The deployment of the application will be done from a separate SSH terminal connected
to the "node3.localhost" instance:

{% highlight bash %}
# Node: node3.localhost
$ cd /home/vagrant/TestApp
$ SPARK_LOCAL_IP=10.11.13.17 ../spark-2.0.1-bin-hadoop2.7/bin/spark-submit \
                     --driver-memory 512m \
                     --master local[2] \
                     /home/vagrant/TestApp/target/scala-2.11/TestApp-assembly-0.0.1.jar 10.11.13.15:9092 events http://10.11.13.17:9292/widgets/alerts
# should see lines of output scrolling...
{% endhighlight %}

**Note**: The above command runs the Spark job locally on the Spark Scheduler node. If you wish to
submit the job to utilize cluster resources (i.e. run the job on "node4.localhost" in background
mode, which is the preferred operation for a more production-like approach), simply add the switch
`--deploy-mode cluster` and update the `--master` parameter to read as `spark://10.11.13.17:7077`.
You will likely also wish to use the `--executor-memory` and `--total-executor-cores` parameters
to define the resource constraints for the job since the virtual machines are not very bulky
instances. Submitting the job in cluster mode, however, will prevent you from easily viewing the
print output embedded in the job itself without going through the web interface, so you are
encouraged to submit locally in a more debug fashion to assist with any troubleshooting that may
need to occur.

Now that you have your full processing pipeline in place, it's time to generate some data to
test the functionality of the system. This exercise is left up to the reader, but in the case
of this tutorial where an Apache instance with access logs is used, simply performing POST
requests against the root URL of the "node1.localhost" web application and varying the number
of requests drastically (more than 20%) should suffice. In doing so, you will see the percent
increase show up in the Kafka `alerts` topic as well as the following output in the Spark job:

```
Capturing POST operations...
...
12 POST operations captured.
...
Writing raw POST data to file...
...
Raw data written to: /tmp/logs/2016-12-27/raw/2155407/
...
Calculating % change from previous batch...
...
% change calculated: 33.33 | (PREV: 8 | CUR: 12)
...
Threshold exceeded - sending alert to Dashboard...
...
Alert sent to Dashboard successfully.
```

Once the above has triggered, inspect your dashboard in the browser (`http://10.11.13.17:9292/stream`).
You should see the "Alerts" table populated with some data corresponding to alerts of exceeded
thresholds.

As a note, the very first time you start the application and send data, it is likely you will see an
alert show up in the Alerts list of the dashboard due to the fact that when you start sending data
while the system is running, any data is more than the 0 data the system was previously receiving.
You can either ignore this, or if you wish to get a more concise test, you can start your steady-state
generation of POST requests **prior** to starting the Spark application, which should ensure the
application calculates a very small (or no) percent change from time zero.

In addition to the alerting, you should be able to inspect the log directory on "node3.localhost"
(where the Spark application is running) for the raw output of POST messages. This is useful for
post-processing or inspection during events, or can be used to re-play messages for future learning
or anomaly detection:

{% highlight bash %}
# Node: node3.localhost
$ ls /tmp/logs/
#   2016-12-30
$ ls /tmp/logs/2016-12-27/
#   raw
$ ls /tmp/logs/2016-12-27/raw/
#   2155407
$ ls /tmp/logs/2016-12-27/raw/2155407
#   part-00000  _SUCCESS
# inspection of part-0000 will show you the POST messages captured during
# the date/time specified in the directory structure
{% endhighlight %}

### Summary

If you've completed this tutorial, you now have a fully-functional stream processing architecture
in place. There are **SEVERE** limitations and risks involved with this particular framework that
have been called out within the article itself. In addition, there are many enhancements that should
likely be made to ensure this processing pipeline and its associated visualization and storage
mechanisms make sense for the business requirements of the task you wish to accomplish.

However, with all disclaimers and warnings aside, this document details the starting point to
understanding and building out a cohesive stream-processing framework for high-volume data ingest
and processing that can be applied to many subject areas. If you have successfully built this
architecture and the end-to-end testing proved successful, you are on your way to understanding
"big data" as it relates to the technology that facilitates processing such information. Be
forewarned, however, that this is just the absolute tip of the iceberg as it relates to this subject
area - many engineers have spent entire careers attempting to understand these concepts and perfect
the principles behind them, so do not get discouraged if it takes a long time to pick up the
concepts and topics within.

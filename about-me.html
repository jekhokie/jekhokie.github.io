                Ever since I gained an interest in becoming an engineer, I have amassed hundreds (if not thousands) of
                emails, Evernote notes, text documents, HTML pages, random documents named "x" or "y", etc. artifacts
                containing information about technology and products I've invested time in exploring, learning and (in
                some cases) mastering. As a way to clean up this information and make it both more useful to myself and
                possibly help others learn from my mistakes and successes, I am now taking the time to publish something
                more formal and public, thus forcing me to refine the presentation of the data to make it more consumable.

                This site is my way of sharing my knowledge and professional profile. It is intended to grow into a
                complete knowledge base and demonstration of my technical (and possibly other) interests and abilities
                as I continue to expand my knowledge of recent technologies and fundamental concepts.
